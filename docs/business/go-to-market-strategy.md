# B2B E-commerce Data Accuracy Platform - Go-to-Market Strategy

## Executive Summary
Launch a focused B2B data accuracy platform targeting mid-market distributors and manufacturers losing revenue to order errors. Start with one vertical (industrial supplies), one integration pair (NetSuite + Shopify B2B), prove ROI through pilot programs, then expand systematically. Target $1M ARR in 12 months, $5M in 24 months.

## Target Market Definition

### Primary Target: Industrial Supplies Distributors
**Why this segment:**
- High SKU count (10,000-100,000 products) maximizes error potential
- Complex pricing with customer contracts and bulk discounts
- Established e-commerce presence but struggling with accuracy
- NetSuite is dominant ERP (40% market share in this segment)

**Ideal Customer Profile:**
- **Revenue**: $10M - $100M annually
- **Catalog Size**: 5,000 - 50,000 active SKUs
- **E-commerce Revenue**: 20-60% of total sales
- **Current State**: Using NetSuite + Shopify B2B or BigCommerce
- **Pain Level**: Processing 50+ orders/day with 20%+ containing errors
- **Team Size**: 2-10 person e-commerce/IT team

### Secondary Targets (Months 7-12):
1. **Electrical Components Distributors** - Similar dynamics, high-value orders
2. **Medical Supplies Distributors** - Accuracy critical for compliance
3. **Auto Parts Distributors** - Complex fitment data adds error potential

### Expansion Markets (Year 2):
- Food Service Distributors (temperature-sensitive delivery accuracy)
- Fashion/Apparel B2B (size/color variant complexity)
- Chemical Distributors (regulatory compliance requirements)
