2. **Configure Integration**
   - Navigate to Integrations > Add New > NetSuite
   - Enter Account ID and Data Center URL
   - Add OAuth credentials
   - Test connection

3. **Run Initial Sync**

   - Configure field mappings if needed
   - Trigger manual sync
   - Monitor progress in sync status tab

#### Dependencies
