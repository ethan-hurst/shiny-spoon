# PRP Implementation Status

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation status of Product Requirement Plans (PRPs) for the TruthSource platform.

## Phase 4 PRPs

### PRP-013: NetSuite Integration ✅ COMPLETED

**Status**: Completed  
**Completion Date**: December 2024  
**Developer**: Claude

#### Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive NetSuite integration with OAuth 2.0 authentication, bi-directional sync capabilities, and real-time webhook support.

#### Key Components Delivered

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - OAuth 2.0 flow with automatic token refresh
   - Secure credential storage with encryption
   - State parameter verification for security
   - Files: `lib/integrations/netsuite/auth.ts`, `app/api/integrations/netsuite/auth/route.ts`

2. **API Client & Rate Limiting**
   - SuiteQL-based data queries
   - Built-in rate limiting with exponential backoff
   - Pagination support for large datasets
   - File: `lib/integrations/netsuite/api-client.ts`

3. **Data Synchronization**
   - Products sync with SKU matching
   - Inventory levels across locations
   - Multi-tier pricing support
   - Customer and order sync capabilities
   - File: `lib/integrations/netsuite/connector.ts`

4. **Data Transformation**
   - Field mapping with custom transformations
   - Unit conversions (weight, dimensions)
   - Date format normalization
   - Custom field support
   - File: `lib/integrations/netsuite/transformers.ts`

5. **Webhook Support**
   - Real-time data updates
   - Signature verification
   - Event processing for products, inventory, customers, orders
   - File: `app/api/webhooks/netsuite/route.ts`

6. **Sync Orchestration**
   - Full and incremental sync modes
   - Batch processing with configurable sizes
   - Progress tracking and error recovery
   - Concurrent entity sync support
   - File: `lib/integrations/netsuite/sync-orchestrator.ts`

7. **UI Components**
   - Configuration form with validation
   - Sync settings management
   - Field mapping editor
   - Real-time sync status dashboard
   - Files: `app/(dashboard)/integrations/netsuite/page.tsx`, `components/features/integrations/netsuite/*`

8. **Testing & Monitoring**
   - Connection test endpoint with comprehensive checks
   - Health monitoring with metrics
   - Performance tracking
   - Error alerting
   - Files: `app/api/integrations/netsuite/test/route.ts`, `app/api/integrations/netsuite/health/route.ts`

#### Database Schema

Created comprehensive schema with:
- `netsuite_config` - Store NetSuite-specific configuration
- `netsuite_sync_state` - Track sync progress per entity type
- `netsuite_webhook_events` - Process webhook events
- Full RLS policies for multi-tenancy

#### Technical Highlights

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with strict types
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and logging
- **Performance**: Efficient batch processing and caching
- **Security**: OAuth 2.0, encrypted credentials, webhook signatures
- **Scalability**: Queue-based processing, rate limiting
- **Monitoring**: Health checks, metrics, alerting

#### Integration Features

1. **Supported Entity Types**
   - Products (items)
   - Inventory levels
   - Pricing (multi-tier)
   - Customers
   - Sales orders

2. **Sync Capabilities**
   - Manual sync triggers
   - Scheduled sync (hourly, daily, weekly)
   - Incremental updates
   - Bulk operations

3. **Configuration Options**
   - Account ID and data center URL
   - OAuth 2.0 client credentials
   - Field mappings
   - Sync frequency
   - Entity selection

#### Known Limitations

1. NetSuite API rate limits (varies by account)
2. SuiteQL query complexity limits
3. Custom record types require additional configuration
4. Some NetSuite fields may require custom transformations

#### Future Enhancements

1. Support for additional entity types (vendors, purchase orders)
2. Advanced conflict resolution
3. Bi-directional sync for orders
4. Custom record type support
5. Enhanced error recovery mechanisms

#### Testing Instructions

1. **Setup OAuth in NetSuite**
   - Create Integration Record with OAuth 2.0
   - Set redirect URI to `https://your-domain/integrations/netsuite/callback`
   - Note Client ID and Client Secret

2. **Configure Integration**
   - Navigate to Integrations > Add New > NetSuite
   - Enter Account ID and Data Center URL
   - Add OAuth credentials
   - Test connection

3. **Run Initial Sync**
   - Select entity types to sync
   - Configure field mappings if needed
   - Trigger manual sync
   - Monitor progress in sync status tab

#### Dependencies

- `@supabase/ssr` - Server-side Supabase client
- `zod` - Schema validation
- Built-in Next.js features (App Router, Server Actions)
