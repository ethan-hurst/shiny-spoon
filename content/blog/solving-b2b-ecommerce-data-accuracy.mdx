# The Hidden Cost of Data Inaccuracy

In B2B e-commerce, data accuracy isn't just a technical challengeâ€”it's a business imperative. With 33% of B2B orders containing errors, distributors face an average annual cost of $400,000 from incorrect shipments, pricing discrepancies, and inventory mismatches.

## Why Traditional Solutions Fall Short

Most businesses rely on:

- **Manual data entry**: Prone to human error and incredibly time-consuming
- **Batch updates**: Create dangerous gaps where data becomes stale
- **Point-to-point integrations**: Become unmaintainable as systems multiply

## The TruthSource Approach

We've built a platform that treats data accuracy as a first-class concern:

### 1. Real-Time Synchronization

```javascript
// Example: Real-time inventory update
const inventoryUpdate = {
  sku: 'WIDGET-123',
  warehouse: 'US-EAST-1',
  quantity: 150,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
}

// Instantly propagated to all connected systems
await truthsource.inventory.update(inventoryUpdate)
```

### 2. Intelligent Conflict Resolution

When systems disagree, our engine:

- Identifies discrepancies in real-time
- Applies configurable business rules
- Maintains an audit trail of all decisions

### 3. Proactive Monitoring

Our accuracy monitoring dashboard shows:

- Sync success rates
- Data freshness metrics
- Anomaly detection alerts

## Real-World Impact

One of our clients, a industrial supplies distributor, saw:

- **87% reduction** in order errors
- **$350,000 saved** annually
- **6 hours/week** saved on manual reconciliation
