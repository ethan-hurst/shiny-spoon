# Getting Started with TruthSource

Welcome to TruthSource! This guide will walk you through setting up your account and connecting your first integration.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Admin access to your ERP system (NetSuite, SAP, etc.)
- API credentials for your e-commerce platform (Shopify B2B, BigCommerce, etc.)
- A TruthSource account ([sign up here](/signup) if you haven't already)

## Step 1: Initial Setup

### Create Your Organization

1. Log into your TruthSource dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Organization**
3. Complete your organization profile:
   - Company name
   - Industry type
   - Primary warehouse locations
   - Default currency

### Configure User Roles

Set up your team with appropriate permissions:

```typescript
const roles = {
  admin: ["full_access"],
  manager: ["view_all", "edit_products", "edit_inventory"],
  operator: ["view_inventory", "update_stock_levels"],
  viewer: ["read_only"]
}
```

## Step 2: Connect Your First Integration

### NetSuite Connection

1. Go to **Integrations** â†’ **Add New**
2. Select **NetSuite** from the list
3. Enter your NetSuite credentials:
   - Account ID
   - Consumer Key
   - Consumer Secret
   - Token ID
   - Token Secret

### Verify Connection

```bash
# Test your connection
truthsource test-connection netsuite

# Expected output:
âœ“ Authentication successful
âœ“ Read permissions verified
âœ“ Write permissions verified
âœ“ Webhook endpoint configured
```

## Step 3: Configure Sync Settings

### Select Data Types to Sync

Choose which data should flow between systems:

- âœ… **Products**: SKUs, descriptions, categories
- âœ… **Inventory**: Stock levels, warehouse locations
- âœ… **Pricing**: Base prices, customer-specific pricing
- âœ… **Customers**: Account information, credit limits

### Set Sync Frequency

**Inventory**: Real-time (High-volume operations)
**Pricing**: Every 15 min (Dynamic pricing)
**Products**: Hourly (Stable catalog)
**Customers**: Daily (B2B accounts)

## Step 4: Map Your Data

### Field Mapping

TruthSource automatically suggests field mappings, but you can customize them:

```json
{
  "product_mappings": {
    "netsuite.internalId": "truthsource.sku",
    "netsuite.displayName": "truthsource.name",
    "netsuite.salesDescription": "truthsource.description",
    "netsuite.basePrice": "truthsource.price"
  }
}
```

### Validation Rules

Set up rules to ensure data quality:

- **Required fields**: SKU, name, price
- **Format validation**: Price must be numeric
- **Business rules**: Inventory cannot be negative

## Step 5: Test Your Integration

### Run a Test Sync

1. Select a small subset of data (e.g., 10 products)
2. Click **Run Test Sync**
3. Review the results in the sync log
4. Verify data in both systems

### Monitor Results

Check the dashboard for:
- Sync success rate
- Processing time
- Any errors or warnings
