# Authentication Fix Deployment Guide

## Issue Description

Users were experiencing an immediate sign-out after login, being redirected to the marketing page. This was caused by a circular dependency in the Row Level Security (RLS) policies for the `user_profiles` table.

### Root Cause

1. **Circular Dependency**: The RLS policy `"Users can view profiles in their org"` used `get_user_organization_id(auth.uid())` to determine access
2. **Function Returns NULL**: When a user first logs in, `get_user_organization_id()` returns `NULL` because the user profile doesn't exist yet or there's a timing issue
3. **Access Denied**: The RLS policy denies access when the function returns `NULL`, preventing users from accessing their own profile
4. **Redirect Loop**: The dashboard page fails to fetch the profile, redirects to login, middleware redirects back to dashboard, creating a loop

## Solution

### 1. Database Migration

Apply the RLS policy fix by running the migration:

```sql
-- File: supabase/migrations/20250131_fix_user_profile_rls_circular_dependency.sql
-- This fixes the circular dependency by:
-- 1. Dropping the problematic policy
-- 2. Creating separate policies for own profile vs organization profiles
-- 3. Making helper functions more robust
```

### 2. Application Updates

#### Updated Files:
- `app/page.tsx` - Better error handling for profile fetching
- `app/setup/page.tsx` - New setup page for users without profiles
- `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` - Added setup page to protected paths

### 3. Key Changes

#### RLS Policy Changes:
```sql
-- OLD (problematic):
CREATE POLICY "Users can view profiles in their org"
  ON user_profiles FOR SELECT
  USING (organization_id = get_user_organization_id(auth.uid()));

-- NEW (fixed):
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile"
  ON user_profiles FOR SELECT
  USING (user_id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "Users can view profiles in their organization"
  ON user_profiles FOR SELECT
  USING (
    organization_id IN (
      SELECT organization_id 
      FROM user_profiles 
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

#### Error Handling:
- Added try-catch blocks around profile fetching
- Better error codes handling (PGRST116 for no rows)
- Graceful fallback to setup page for new users

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Migration

**Option A: Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run the contents of `supabase/migrations/20250131_fix_user_profile_rls_circular_dependency.sql`

**Option B: Supabase CLI**
```bash
# Apply the migration
supabase db push

# Or run the SQL directly
supabase db reset --linked
```

**Option C: Direct SQL**
1. Copy the contents of `scripts/apply-rls-fix.sql`
2. Run in your Supabase SQL editor

### 2. Application Deployment

**Option A: Vercel (Recommended)**
```bash
# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

**Option B: Manual Deployment**
1. Build the application: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the built files to your hosting platform

### 3. Verification

#### Test Cases:
1. **New User Registration**: Sign up a new user and verify they can access the dashboard
2. **Existing User Login**: Login with an existing user and verify they stay logged in
3. **Profile Access**: Verify users can view their own profile and organization data
4. **Admin Functions**: Verify admin users can manage other users in their organization

#### Monitoring:
- Check application logs for any RLS policy errors
- Monitor user authentication success rates
- Verify no redirect loops occur

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, you can rollback by:

1. **Database Rollback**:
```sql
-- Revert RLS policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view profiles in their organization" ON user_profiles;

-- Restore original policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can view profiles in their org"
  ON user_profiles FOR SELECT
  USING (organization_id = get_user_organization_id(auth.uid()));
```

2. **Application Rollback**: Deploy the previous version of the application

## Security Considerations

### RLS Policy Security:
- Users can only access their own profile directly
- Organization-wide access is still restricted to same organization
- Admin functions remain protected
- No security vulnerabilities introduced

### Data Protection:
- All existing RLS policies remain intact
- Organization isolation is maintained
- User data privacy is preserved

## Performance Impact

### Minimal Impact:
- RLS policies are optimized for performance
- Helper functions use efficient queries
- No additional database load
- Improved user experience reduces support tickets

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Key Metrics to Monitor:
1. **Authentication Success Rate**: Should increase after fix
2. **User Session Duration**: Should improve
3. **Error Rates**: RLS policy errors should decrease
4. **Support Tickets**: Login-related issues should decrease

### Alerts to Set Up:
- High authentication failure rates
- RLS policy errors in logs
- Redirect loop detection
- User session timeout issues

## Support Documentation

### For Users:
- Clear error messages for authentication issues
- Setup page for new users
- Contact support if issues persist

### For Developers:
- Updated authentication flow documentation
- RLS policy documentation
- Error handling guidelines

## Future Improvements

### Planned Enhancements:
1. **Real-time Profile Creation**: Webhook-based profile creation
2. **Better Error Messages**: More user-friendly error handling
3. **Profile Recovery**: Automatic profile recovery for orphaned users
4. **Audit Logging**: Track profile creation and access patterns

### Monitoring Enhancements:
1. **Detailed Analytics**: Track authentication flow success rates
2. **Performance Metrics**: Monitor RLS policy performance
3. **User Journey Tracking**: Understand user onboarding flow
