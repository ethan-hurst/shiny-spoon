# Test Coverage Audit Report

## Overview
This audit evaluates the current test coverage for TruthSource's implemented features, following the testing pyramid approach.

## Testing Pyramid Analysis

### 1. Unit Tests (Base of Pyramid - Should be Most Numerous)

#### ✅ Well Covered Areas:
- **Pricing Engine**
  - `calculate-price.test.ts` - Price calculation logic
  - `pricing-engine.test.ts` - Core pricing engine
  - `pricing-behavior.test.ts` - Pricing business logic
  - `shopify/pricing-manager.test.ts` - Shopify pricing integration

- **Sync Engine Core**
  - `sync-engine.test.ts` - Main sync engine (but uses `any` types)
  - `inventory-sync-service.test.ts` - Inventory sync service
  - `webhook-service.test.ts` - Webhook processing
  - `sync-scheduler.test.ts` - Sync scheduling

- **Utilities**
  - `utils.test.ts` - Utility functions

#### ❌ Missing Unit Tests:
- **Integrations**
  - `base-connector.ts` - No tests for base connector class
  - `netsuite/connector.ts` - No unit tests for NetSuite connector
  - `netsuite/api-client.ts` - No tests for API client
  - `netsuite/transformers.ts` - No tests for data transformers
  - `shopify/connector.ts` - No unit tests (only helper tests exist)
  - `shopify/api-client.ts` - No tests for Shopify API client

- **Core Services**
  - `realtime/connection-manager.ts` - No tests for real-time connections
  - `monitoring/accuracy-checker.ts` - No tests for accuracy monitoring
  - `monitoring/anomaly-detector.ts` - No tests for anomaly detection
  - `bulk/bulk-operations-engine.ts` - No tests for bulk operations
  - `email/email-queue.ts` - No tests for email queue
  - `audit/audit-logger.ts` - No tests for audit logging

- **Data Services**
  - `inventory/calculations.ts` - No tests for inventory calculations
  - `customers/validations.ts` - No tests for customer validation
  - `csv/parser.ts` - No tests for CSV parsing
  - `csv/product-import.ts` - No tests for product import

### 2. Integration Tests (Middle Layer - Moderate Amount)

#### ✅ Well Covered Areas:
- **Sync Integration**
  - `sync-engine.integration.test.ts` - Full sync flow testing
  - `webhook-processing.test.ts` - Webhook integration testing
  - `sync-engine-behavior.test.ts` - Behavioral integration tests

- **Database/RLS**
  - `rls-policies.test.ts` - Row Level Security testing

- **Actions**
  - `actions/pricing.test.ts` - Server action integration tests

#### ❌ Missing Integration Tests:
- **Integration Connections**
  - No tests for actual NetSuite connection flow
  - No tests for actual Shopify connection flow
  - No tests for OAuth flows

- **Data Flow**
  - No tests for inventory sync with real data
  - No tests for pricing sync across systems
  - No tests for customer data sync

- **Real-time Features**
  - No tests for real-time updates via Supabase
  - No tests for offline queue behavior

### 3. End-to-End Tests (Top of Pyramid - Few but Critical)

#### ✅ Well Covered Areas:
- **Sync Workflows**
  - `sync-workflow.e2e.test.ts` - Complete sync user journey
  - `integration-management.e2e.test.ts` - Integration setup and management

#### ❌ Missing E2E Tests:
- **Core User Journeys**
  - No E2E tests for pricing rule creation workflow
  - No E2E tests for inventory management workflow
  - No E2E tests for customer portal access
  - No E2E tests for order processing workflow
  - No E2E tests for bulk operations

- **Critical Business Flows**
  - No E2E tests for complete order-to-fulfillment flow
  - No E2E tests for pricing approval workflow
  - No E2E tests for alert and remediation flow

## Component Test Coverage

### ❌ No Component Tests Found For:
- All React components in `components/` directory
- All page components in `app/` directory
- Form components and validations
- UI interactions and state management

## Test Quality Issues

### 1. Type Safety
- Many tests use `any` types for mocks (violates new guidelines)
- Missing proper type assertions
- Mock data doesn't match database schema types

### 2. Test Structure
- Some tests lack proper arrange-act-assert structure
- Missing edge case coverage
- No error scenario testing in many areas

### 3. Mock Quality
- Mocks don't accurately represent real service behavior
- Missing mock utilities for common patterns
- No shared test data factories

## Recommendations

### High Priority (Critical Business Logic)
1. **Add Unit Tests for Connectors**
   - NetSuite connector and transformers
   - Shopify connector and API client
   - Base connector abstract class

2. **Add Integration Tests for Data Sync**
   - Real database integration tests
   - Cross-system data flow tests
   - Error handling and retry logic

3. **Add E2E Tests for Core Workflows**
   - Order processing flow
   - Pricing rule management
   - Inventory management

### Medium Priority (Supporting Features)
1. **Add Unit Tests for Services**
   - Monitoring and alerting
   - Bulk operations
   - CSV import/export
   - Email notifications

2. **Add Component Tests**
   - Form components with validation
   - Data tables with filtering/sorting
   - Dashboard components

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. **Performance Tests**
   - Load testing for sync operations
   - Benchmark tests for pricing calculations

2. **Visual Regression Tests**
   - UI component screenshots
   - Responsive design tests

## Test Distribution Analysis

### Current State:
- Unit Tests: ~15 files (should be 50+)
- Integration Tests: ~7 files (adequate)
- E2E Tests: ~3 files (needs 5-10)

### Target State:
- Unit Tests: 80% of all tests
- Integration Tests: 15% of all tests
- E2E Tests: 5% of all tests

## Critical Gaps Summary

1. **No tests for integration connectors** - High risk for production issues
2. **No component tests** - UI bugs will slip through
3. **Poor type safety in existing tests** - Tests don't validate types
4. **Missing error scenario coverage** - Unknown behavior in failure cases
5. **No performance benchmarks** - Can't detect performance regressions

## Next Steps

1. Fix type safety in existing tests (remove `any` types)
2. Create shared test utilities and factories
3. Add unit tests for all connector classes
4. Add E2E tests for critical business workflows
5. Implement component testing framework

## Estimated Effort

- Fix existing tests: 1-2 days
- Add missing unit tests: 3-5 days
- Add missing integration tests: 2-3 days
- Add missing E2E tests: 2-3 days
- Add component tests: 3-4 days

Total: 11-17 days to achieve comprehensive test coverage
