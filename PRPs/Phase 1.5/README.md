# Phase 1.5: Public-Facing Front-End PRPs

This phase addresses the gap in public-facing functionality that was discovered during the implementation review. While the original PRPs focused heavily on the internal dashboard and B2B features, they lacked comprehensive planning for the public website, marketing pages, and customer self-service capabilities.

## Why Phase 1.5?

During the PRP-004 implementation review, it was discovered that:

- No PRPs covered the public-facing marketing website
- Authentication pages existed but weren't properly linked from public navigation
- The existing public website implementation wasn't planned in any PRP
- Critical features like documentation, blog, and customer portal were missing

## PRPs in This Phase

### PRP-001A: Public Website Foundation

**Goal**: Create a comprehensive public-facing website with proper landing pages, marketing content, and navigation.

- Professional homepage with real content
- Feature showcase pages
- Company/about pages
- Legal pages (terms, privacy)
- Contact forms
- SEO optimization

### PRP-001B: Content Management System

**Goal**: Implement a flexible CMS for blog posts, documentation, and help articles.

- MDX-based content system
- Blog with categories and tags
- Documentation portal
- Help center with search
- RSS feed generation
- Content versioning

### PRP-001C: Customer Portal & Self-Service

**Goal**: Build a customer portal for subscription management, billing, and usage monitoring.

- Subscription management
- Invoice history
- Payment methods
- Usage dashboards
- API key management
- Team management

### PRP-001D: Developer Portal & API Documentation

**Goal**: Create comprehensive developer documentation with interactive API docs and SDKs.

- Interactive API documentation
- SDK libraries and docs
- Integration guides
- Webhook documentation
- Code examples
- API changelog

## Implementation Order

These PRPs should be implemented after Phase 1 (Foundation) but can be done in parallel with Phase 2 (Core Features):

1. **PRP-001A** should be implemented first as it provides the public-facing structure
2. **PRP-001B** can be implemented in parallel or after 001A
3. **PRP-001C** requires authentication (PRP-003) and should integrate with billing
4. **PRP-001D** can be started after 001A and benefits from 001B for guides

## Integration Points

These PRPs integrate with existing implementations:

- Uses Supabase authentication from PRP-003
- Leverages existing UI components and design system
- Integrates with Stripe for payments (existing in codebase)
- Connects to dashboard features for authenticated users

## Success Metrics

- Complete visitor-to-customer journey
- Self-service capabilities reduce support load
- Developer adoption through good documentation
- Content marketing improves SEO and acquisition
- Professional presence builds trust

## Notes

- These PRPs fill a critical gap in the original implementation plan
- They focus on external users (visitors, customers, developers) vs internal users
- Each PRP is self-contained but builds on the foundation
- Implementation can be iterative - launch with core features and enhance over time
