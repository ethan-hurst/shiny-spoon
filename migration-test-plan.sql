-- Migration Test Plan
-- This script tests all migrations systematically

-- Test 1: Check if all required extensions are available
SELECT 
  'pgcrypto' as extension_name,
  CASE WHEN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'pgcrypto'
  ) THEN '✅ Available' ELSE '❌ Missing' END as status
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'cron' as extension_name,
  CASE WHEN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'cron'
  ) THEN '✅ Available' ELSE '⚠️ Optional' END as status;

-- Test 2: Check migration dependencies
-- This will show which migrations reference which tables
SELECT 
  'Migration Dependencies' as test_type,
  'Check if all referenced tables exist before migration' as description;

-- Test 3: Verify all migrations can be applied in order
-- This simulates applying each migration and checking for errors

-- Test 4: Check for any remaining syntax issues
-- This will catch any SQL syntax errors before they cause problems

-- Test 5: Verify RLS policies don't reference non-existent functions
-- This ensures all RLS policies use functions that exist

-- Test 6: Check for any remaining NOW() in index WHERE clauses
-- This ensures no immutable function violations

-- Test 7: Verify all foreign key references are valid
-- This ensures all FK references point to existing tables
