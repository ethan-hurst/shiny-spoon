## 🔧 Technical Debt & Improvements

### High Priority
1. **Fix TypeScript Errors**
   - Fix async Supabase client usage pattern across all dashboard pages
   - Remove all implicit `any` types
   - Ensure all functions have explicit return types

2. **Complete Order Management Features**
   - Add order confirmation email sending
   - Implement invoice generation
   - Add shipping integration
   - Create order tracking functionality

3. **Enhance Error Handling**
   - Add retry logic for failed operations
   - Implement proper error boundaries for all routes
   - Create user-friendly error messages
   - Add fallback UI for failed states

4. **Implement Rate Limiting**
   ```typescript
   // Example for order creation endpoint
   import { Ratelimit } from '@upstash/ratelimit'
   import { Redis } from '@upstash/redis'

   const ratelimit = new Ratelimit({
     redis: Redis.fromEnv(),
     limiter: Ratelimit.slidingWindow(10, '1 m'), // 10 requests per minute
   })
   ```

### Medium Priority
1. **Add Comprehensive Testing**
   - Unit tests for all server actions
   - Integration tests for API routes
   - E2E tests for critical user journeys
   - Performance benchmarks

2. **Improve Data Validation**
   - Add Zod schemas for all API inputs
   - Implement request sanitization
   - Add data integrity checks
   - Validate file uploads

3. **Enhance Security**
   - Implement API key rotation
   - Add IP whitelisting for admin features
   - Enable audit logging for all sensitive operations
   - Add suspicious activity detection

### Low Priority
1. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Add skeleton loaders for all async operations
   - Implement optimistic updates
   - Add keyboard shortcuts
   - Enhance mobile experience

2. **Performance Enhancements**
   - Implement query result caching
   - Add database connection pooling
   - Optimize bundle splitting
   - Implement lazy loading for images

## 📊 Monitoring Setup

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Business Metrics**
   - Order creation rate
   - Order error rate
   - Average order value
   - Customer satisfaction score

2. **Technical Metrics**
   - API response times
   - Database query performance
   - Error rates by endpoint
   - Cache hit rates

3. **Infrastructure Metrics**
   - CPU and memory usage
   - Database connections
   - Queue lengths
   - Webhook delivery rates

### Alert Thresholds
```yaml
alerts:
  - name: high_error_rate
    condition: error_rate > 5%
    duration: 5m
    severity: critical
    
  - name: slow_api_response
    condition: p95_latency > 2000ms
    duration: 10m
    severity: warning
    
  - name: low_stock_items
    condition: low_stock_count > 50
    duration: 30m
    severity: info
```

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures
